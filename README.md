**Description**

- Software for live performance video control at the 2023 UBC WinterBang! Festival.
- Employed Max with commercial hardware to generate data from dance and gesture tracking. Applied data to adjust video parameters, including audio and image position in real-time. Utilized Jitter to dynamically layer and crossfade multiple videos. This involved the use of line objects to implement smooth transitions and generate pulsating effects for brightness.
